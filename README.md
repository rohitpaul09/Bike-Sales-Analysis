# Bike-Sales-Analysis

This project encompassed a detailed examination of a bike sales dataset, leading to actionable insights:

- **Data Cleaning**: Removed duplicates, spaces, special characters, and standardized formatting.
- **Enhanced Data Analysis**: Created nested functions and custom columns for deeper insights.
- **Visualization Tools**: Utilized pivot tables, charts, and graphs for data representation.
- **Interactive Dashboard**: Integrated slicers for dynamic user interaction within the dashboard.

Key Insights:

- **Demographic Trends**: Male customers, with an average income of $60,000, purchase more bikes compared to females who have 7% less average income.
- **Family Influence**: Couples with 1 or 2 children are more likely to buy bikes.
- **Age Factor**: Middle-aged customers (31-54 years) are predominant purchasers, buying four times more bikes than adolescents or the elderly.
- **Commute Distance**: Higher bike purchases for shorter commutes (0-1 miles) over longer ones (over 10 miles).

These insights enable companies to target customers more effectively based on variables like income, age, distance, marital status, region, and education. This strategic approach can significantly improve marketing tactics and enhance overall bike sales.
