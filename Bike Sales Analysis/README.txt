Excited to share my latest project - Bike Sales Analysis using Excel! 🚴‍♂️📊

The objective was to create a dashboard to analyze bike sales count and factors affecting demand. Here's what I did:

Analyzed the dataset provided.
Cleaned the data by removing duplicates, spaces, special characters, and formatting.
Created nested functions and custom columns to get additional information.
Built Pivot tables, Charts and Graphs to visually summarize the data.
Added slicers for user interaction and created a dashboard.
Key insights:

Male customers have an average income of $60,000 and purchase more bikes than females, who have 7% less average income.
Couples with 1 or 2 children tend to buy bikes more.
Middle-aged customers (31-54 years) purchase 4 times more bikes than Adolescent or Old age groups.
Customers tend to purchase bikes more for shorter commutes (0-1 miles) than longer ones (more than 10 miles).
This project can help companies determine their target customers based on factors such as income, age, distance, martial status, region, and education. It can also provide a basis for developing new strategies to improve marketing and overall sales of bikes.

I'm confident that the skills I gained during this project will be valuable in my future endeavors. Please share your thoughts for further improvement! 🤝
